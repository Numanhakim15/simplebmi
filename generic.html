								<h3>Diet</h3>
								<p>Focus on eating at least five to seven servings of whole fruits and vegetables every day. Fruits and vegetables constitute low-calorie foods. According to WHO, there is convincing evidence that eating fruits and vegetables decreases the risk of obesity. They contain higher amounts of nutrients and are associated with a lower risk for diabetes and insulin resistance. Their fiber content in particular helps you feel full with fewer calories, helping to prevent weight gain. Highly processed foods, like white bread and many boxed snack foods, are a common source of empty calories, which tend to add up quickly. A 2019 study found that subjects who were offered a highly processed diet consumed more calories and gained weight, while those offered a minimally processed diet ate less and lost weight.</p>

								<p>It is important to keep your intake of added sugars low. The American Heart Association recommends that the intake of added sugar not exceed six teaspoons daily for women and nine teaspoons daily for men. Major sources of added sugar to avoid include sugary beverages, including sodas and energy or sports drinks; grain desserts like pies, cookies, and cakes; fruit drinks (which are seldom 100% fruit juice); candy; and dairy desserts like ice cream. Artificial sweeteners have been linked to obesity and diabetes. If you feel you must use a sweetener, opt for a small amount of honey, which is a natural alternative.</p>

								<h4>Exercise</h4>
								<p>Most national and international guidelines recommend that the average adult get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. That means at least 30 minutes per day, five days a week. Researchers found that individuals who walk at a brisk or fast pace are more likely to have a lower weight, lower body mass index (BMI), and lower waist circumference compared to individuals doing other activities. In addition, experts recommend keeping active throughout the day, whether by using a standing desk, taking frequent stretch breaks, or finding ways to work in walking meetings throughout your day.</p>

								<p>The best exercise for maintaining a healthy weight is brisk walking, according to analysis of data from the 2015 Health Survey for England.</p>

								<h3>Relax</h3>
								<p>Chronic stress raises levels of the stress hormone cortisol and leads to weight gain. It can also result in poor dietary choices, as cortisol and other stress hormones can increase “carb cravings” and make it difficult to exercise good judgment and willpower. Look into the many healthy ways to beat stress, and find what works best for you. Go for a daily walk, engage in regular yoga or tai chi, meditate, listen to music you love, get together with friends, or do whatever else relaxes you and brings you joy.</p>
							
								<p>Studies show having a pet can lower blood pressure. Additionally, pets, especially dogs, can increase your level of physical activity and help you stave off weight gain.</p>

								<h4>Sleep</h4>
								<p>The role of sleep in overall well-being cannot be overstated. This extends to the goal of preventing obesity, too. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends seven or more hours of sleep for adults 18 and over, and even more sleep for younger people. Studies have linked later bedtimes to weight gain over time. One study of nearly 3,500 adolescents who were followed between 1994 and 2009 found that a “later average bedtime during the workweek, in hours, from adolescence to adulthood was associated with an increase in BMI over time.”</p>
								
								<p>In another study, researchers found that late bedtimes, and therefore less nightly sleep, for 4-year-old and 5-year-old children resulted in a greater likelihood of obesity over time. Specifically, the researchers found that the odds of becoming obese were higher for children who slept less than about 9.5 hours per night, as well as for children who went to bed at 9 p.m. or later.</p>
